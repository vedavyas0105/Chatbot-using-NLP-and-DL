# Chatbot-using-NLP-and-DL
This Jupyter Notebook implements a simple NLP-based chatbot using PyTorch and NLTK. It includes tokenization, stemming, and training a neural network on intent-based data from a JSON file. The chatbot processes user inputs, classifies intents, and generates appropriate responses. Ideal for beginners exploring deep learning and NLP in Python.
